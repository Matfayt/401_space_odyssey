# 401_space_odyssey
 This repository contains the mains materials used to created a rythm multiplayer game from Unity using OSC communication to sync with Max/MSP and Ableton Live 10.
 
 401 a space Odyssey is a rythm game inspired bay Spielbrerg and Cubric aesthetics. It is meant to be displayed on a full dome configuration and for 8 channel audio.
 
 This project is part of an academic work for Aix-Marseille University and Marseille's Planetarium. This was a one week Hackaton to introduce students to Unity deployment and OSC streams.
 
 This repo was mainly dedicated to team work but stays open as a ressource for anyone.
